above is a screenshot of my current setup :)

it's an awesome experience so far.

i have pretty much moved my daily operation to this machine. added two drives, one for music, the other as a staging area between my downloading machine and my unraid server (since i do some manipulation on the files i get).

these are the apps i generally use

### BROWSER

chrome is very lightweight here, and i haven't seen it crash yet. opera is pretty good as well, firefox consumes a lot of memory and safari, i didn't quite try

### MUSIC

i'm evaluating different music players

- [instinctiv (free)](http://www.instinctiv.com)
- [audirvana (free)](http://www.audirvana.com)
- [vox (free)](http://www.voxapp.didgeroo.com/)
- [decibel (paid)](http://sbooth.org/Decibel/)

### MOVIES

i've pretty much settled on [MPlayer OSX Extended](http://www.mplayerosx.ch/) for movies

### IMAGES

had to install [xnview](http://www.xnview.com), didn't quite find the same functionality in other apps.


## the good

- having unix underpinnings is just huge. i'm a developer so it's so great to be able to do unix stuff at the terminal [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com)
- installing applications either from the mac app store or downloaded from the internet is so cool and simple
- the general awesomeness of it all.

## the bad

- im using a pc keyboard, so i'm still getting used to the shortcuts
- i haven't found a replacement for 7zip. keka is just not there for me.

## the ugly

<em>FINDER</em> ... i find it cumbersome to use ... to perform simple operations i need a ton of windows open and then use some keyboard shortcuts ... i've installed [muCommander](http://www.mucommander.com), [magican file](http://www.magicansoft.com), [path finder](http://www.cocoatech.com), [total finder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/)Â ... but not decided yet what to use ... then there are like a ton of views in finder .. and none seems really useful to me 8)

but overall, i'm impressed and love my hackmac !
