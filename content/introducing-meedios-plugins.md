## Rationale
[MeediOS](http://www.meedios.com/) is an open source HTPC media center application.

Although it’s currently still an alpha version, it has become very stable and has an active development team working on improving it and making it ready for a beta release.

You can get gorgeous HTPC navigation, applying user interface themes (skins) such as [Evolution](http://www.meedios.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4804).

In order to make it work, you have to import your media files, namely your movies, tv shows episodes, pictures, etc.

Although MeediOS currently has some file importers, I set out to create some alternate ones, to better suit my needs.

One for Movies and one for Tv Shows

## Product

Based on regular expressions to parse your media files and smart logic to speed up scanning times.
